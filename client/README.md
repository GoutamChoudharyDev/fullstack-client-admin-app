# Full Stack Client–Admin Management Web Application

## 1. Project Overview
The **Full Stack Client–Admin Management Web Application** is a production-ready web platform designed to manage client-related data through an intuitive admin interface. The application enables administrators to add, view, update, and delete client information along with profile images.

The project follows a modern **full-stack architecture**, with a responsive frontend built using **React (Vite)** and a robust backend developed using **Node.js and Express**. The application is fully deployed on cloud platforms, making it accessible from anywhere.

---

## 2. Objectives
- To build a real-world **full-stack web application**
- To implement a **client management system** with admin controls
- To integrate **image upload functionality using Cloudinary**
- To use **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud-based database management
- To deploy frontend and backend using modern hosting platforms
- To follow best practices in API design and environment configuration

## 4. Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Multer
- Cloudinary

### Database
- MongoDB Atlas

### Deployment

## 5. System Architecture
The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs. The backend processes requests, manages business logic, and interacts with the MongoDB database. Uploaded images are stored on Cloudinary, and only image URLs are saved in the database. Environment variables are used to securely manage sensitive configuration values.

---

## 6. Deployment Details
- The frontend is deployed on **Vercel**, providing fast global access.
- The backend is deployed on **Render**, handling API requests and database operations.
- MongoDB Atlas is used for cloud-based data persistence.
- Cloudinary is used for efficient and secure image storage.

---

## 7. Use Case
This application can be used by organizations or businesses to manage:
- Client profiles
- Team members
- Testimonials
- Partners or collaborators

The admin dashboard simplifies content management without direct database interaction.

## 8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a **full-stack web application**, including development, cloud integration, environment management, and deployment. It reflects practical industry-level skills and is suitable for academic submission, portfolio presentation, and real-world usage.
